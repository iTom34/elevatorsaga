# Hi :wave:

This project is a docker image of the game elevatorsage (https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga), a open source web browser game, where you have code an elevator algorithm.

## Requirements
If you want to run the game in a docker container you need:

- `docker-compose.yml` Docker configuration description. Find a template in the repository (https://github.com/iTom34/elevatorsaga)

## Run server
To run the server `docker-compose up`
To stop the server `docker-compose down`
To pull the latest version of the container `docker-compose pull`

Enjoy :smiley:

## Contact
If I didn't update the repository with the latest version, feel free to ping me on github :wink:
